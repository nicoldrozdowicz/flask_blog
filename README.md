# Project Summary
I created this blog in order learn more about the flask web framework. Although not an exact copy, this application is heavily inspired by Corey Schafer's flask tutorials on youtube.

# Running the application
- This flask application was written using python 3.9.5. You can install python at python.org. 
- Once you have python installed, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project directory. This will install all the packages required for running this flask application.
- To start the application, run `python3 run.py` from the project directory. Navigate to the specified URL to interact with the blog.
